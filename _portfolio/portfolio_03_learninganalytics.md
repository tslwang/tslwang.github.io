Cluey strives to ensure the highest standard of teaching and pedagogy between tutors and learning sessions. This is a difficult endeavour since the company employs hundreds of tutors for a variety of school years and subjects. In order to manage tutor performance, the company has implemented a program in which sessions are manually reviewed by senior tutors. The review scores rating (1-4) on a number of teaching attributes (e.g., pace of session, quality of explanation and questioning). Identifying the session events and tutor behaviours are critical to improving teaching quality and training. The key challenges for this project are 1) some teaching attributes are qualitative in nature 2) predicting imbalanced classes and 3) varied nature of sessions between different subjects and year levels.
