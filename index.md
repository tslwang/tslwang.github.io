### Welcome
Data drives decision-making in numerous industries including financial services, healthcare, and retail. Machine learning algorithms provide profound insights in consumer decisions and behaviours. Similarly, data analytics have great potential to improve student learning in education.

Currently, I am the Senior Data Scientist at [Cluey Learning] (https://clueylearning.com.au/). At Cluey, our peer-to-peer learning platform provides the opportunity to continuously measure what and how students learn. As a consequence, the needs of the students are constantly monitored and adapted to optimise the efficiency of their learning.

I am a Data Scientist with expertise in machine learning, non-parametric modelling, and the use of experimental methods for scientific research. I received my PhD in Psyhology from [The University of New South Wales] (https://www.unsw.edu.au/). I spend time working as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at both the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/) and [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/)
