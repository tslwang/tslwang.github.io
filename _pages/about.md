Hi! I'm Tony, a Senior Data Scientist at [Domain Group](http://domain.com.au). I have experience in the following areas:
- **Classification modelling**: predict online teaching quality using behavioural data
- **Computational modelling**: build mathematical models to explain human behaviour and cognition
- **Natural language processing**: topic modelling and semantic analysis to build content recommendation systems
- **Propensity modelling**: predicting customer churn and lifetime value using product, customer, and behavioural analytics

I have ten years experience applying quantitative research and data science to solve problems in cognitive psychology, neuroscience, teaching and education, digital marketing, and business strategy. At Domain, I support the CRM and Lifecycle team by building models to predict customer propensity and lifetime value in order to optimise their B2B and B2C direct marketing. Previously, I also held the position of Senior Data Scientist at two high-growth tech start-up companies, [Metigy](http://metigy.com) and [Cluey Learning](https://clueylearning.com.au). 

At [Metigy](http://metigy.com), I applied machine learning techniques to help SMEs develop and optimise their digital marketing. I developed a content recommendation system to help users to personalise their creative content. I also helped to develop models that predicted the ROI on social media advertising spend. 

At [Cluey Learning](https://clueylearning.com.au). I was chiefly responsible for designing and building the data analytics and machine learning platforms. I also lead quantitive reserch projects that seek to develop innovative learning analytics and tools to support online teaching and learning. 

Earlier in my career, I conducted quantitative research in the field of cognitive neuroscience and psychology. From 2015 to 2018, I was a Research Scientist at [Brown University](http://brown.edu) working with [A/Prof Joo-Hyun Song](https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/people/faculty/joo-hyun-song). My research projects utilised computational models to understand the cognitive and neural mechanisms involved in human motor learning. From 2012 to 2015, I was a Research Scientist at [The University of Melbourne](http://unimelb.edu.au) working with [A/Prof Daniel R. Little](https://psychologicalsciences.unimelb.edu.au/research/msps-research-groups/knowlab). My projects focused on utilising computational and machine learning models to explain human memory and decision making. 

I was awarded my PhD in Psychology in 2012 from [UNSW Sydney](http://unsw.edu.au) under the supervision of [Prof. Chris Mitchell](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/christopher-mitchell).
