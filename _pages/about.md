Hi! I'm Tony, a Senior Data Scientist at [Cluey Learning](https://clueylearning.com.au). I have experience in the following areas:
- **Predictive modelling**: predict online teaching quality using auditory and behavioural data
- **Computational modelling**: build statistical and mathematical models to explain human cognition
- **Natural language processing**: topic modelling and semantic analysis on user written feedback 
- **Reinforcement learning**: build neural networks to explain motor learning 
- **Churn modelling**: predicting customer retention based on behavioural data 

I have ten years experience applying quantitative research and data science to solve problems in cognitive psychology, neuroscience, teaching and education, and business strategy. At Cluey Learning, I am chiefly responsible for designing and building the data analytics and machine learning platforms. I also lead quantitive reserch projects that seek to develop innovative learning analytics and tools to support online teaching and learning. 

Previously, I was a Research Scientist at [Brown University](http://brown.edu) working with [A/Prof Joo-Hyun Song](https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/people/faculty/joo-hyun-song) from 2015 to 2018. My research projects utilised computational models to understand the cognitive and neural mechanisms involved in human motor learning. From 2012 to 2015, I was a Reserach Scientist at [The University of Melbourne](http://unimelb.edu.au) working with [A/Prof Daniel R. Little](https://psychologicalsciences.unimelb.edu.au/research/msps-research-groups/knowlab). My projects focussed on utilising computational and machine learning models to explain human memory and decision making. 

I was awarded my PhD in Psychology in 2012 from [UNSW Sydney](http://unsw.edu.au) under the supervision of [Prof. Chris Mitchell](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/christopher-mitchell).
